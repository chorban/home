			<li>What to see
				<ol>
					<li><p>The Alhambra: The Alhambra is a beautiful red-walled palace situated on top of the hill “al-Sabika”, in the west of 
					the city of Granada. It has a view of the whole city, as it was initially a military fortress in the 9th century. The Alhambra’s most 
					famous period began when the first king of the Nasrid Dynasty (Mohammed ben Al-Hamar) arrived in the 13th century. The Alhambra became the
					royal residence of the Nasrid dynasty and many major upgrades were made throughout their generations, including the Comares Palace, the 
					Palace of the Lions, and the Partal Palace from the 14th century. The poems and Quran verses, appearing on so many of Alhambra’s walls, 
					were engraved at this time in an intertwining fashion. Later from the 16th to the 20th century, during the time of the Catholic Monarchs, a
					new fourth palace, Palace of Charles V,  was constructed for the Roman Emperor Charles V.</p><p>Also very popular are the Generalife Gardens around the Alhambra, built by the Nasrid rulers. It has water channels, fountains, lush 
					greenery making it a paradisiacal retreat for anyone!<p>
					</li>
					<li>Sacromonte:</li>
					<li>The Sierra Nevada: <p>The Sierra Nevada is a striking snowy mountain range an hour’s drive from Granada city. It is best known for its 
					touristic ski resort and national park, but also hidden cultural experiences in its small towns. </p><p>The Sierra Nevada contains Europe’s southernmost ski resort on the slopes of Pico de Veleta, Spain’s third highest mountain peak, just 30 
					minutes away from Granada city. The ski season is from November to May, and is suitable for skiers of all experience levels.</p>
					In the mountain range is also the peaceful and quiet Sierra Nevada National Park, the largest national park in Spain, holding the highest 
					mountain peak in Spain: Mulhacén. Providing hiking and biking trails in the open air, with rare flower species, birds, lizards, and Ibex 
					along the way, it is an ideal location for outdoor-lovers in Andalucia!</p><p>You may also want to stroll through Sierra Nevada’s 
					white-washed villages in Las Alpujarras. The Trevelez village is famous for its cured ham, winding streets, restaurants, and souvenir shops.
					The similar village of Capileira is known for its 18th century church, and traditional handicrafts.</p>
